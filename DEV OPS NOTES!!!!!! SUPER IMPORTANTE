DEV OPS NOTES!!!!!! SUPER IMPORTANTE

1.  NEVER SAVE IMPORTANT DATA
2.  NEVER RUN AS ROOT
3.  BE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT SECURITY

TO START

*command* ssh admin@softcoreos.deavleague.com -p PORT**

**NGINX**

*command* `sudo apt-get install nginx`  // we do this to install nginx to our box

It allows us to route things like express... but to your cloud server
FASTER THAN OTHERS AND EASIER TO CONFIGURE
FREE
SPEED AND SECURITY
IT CAN HANDLE MORE REQUESTS THAN YOUR NODE APP
    - nginx is on top of your "box" it routes your request like express to either static files or server in your box
    - it can handle your ssl certs
**CLI COMMANDS WHEN IN SOFTCOREOS**

//cd into nginx
**cd /etc/nginx**
**cd sites-enabled**
**cat default**
**cd sites-enabled**
**sudo cp default default.bak**
**cd sites-available**
**vi default** //edit default file to your server in sites available
** sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default** //linking file we want to reference and location we want to put it
//go to home director *cd*
ls /var??
**sudo mkdir var/www**

**sudo service --status-all**
//check your config
**sudo service nginx configtest**
//always test your config to test your file!!!!**
//always test before you restart or reload

changing service:
    restart: gracefully stop and start gracefully
    reload: doesn't restart service, just reloads your service.. makes sure no request dies..it re-reads your configuration and loads it

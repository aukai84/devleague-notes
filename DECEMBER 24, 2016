**STREAMS**

READ A PIECE OF DATA AS A DATA STREAM

CONSUMING THE DATA STREAM
  - taking little chunks of data from the data source and doing something with it
  - take chunk and write that specific chunk to a file that is open

  **OPEN A FILE**
    - manipulate data streams as objects and use PIPE

    1.  Abstract inferface
    2.  Generic enough to be readable or writeable if it makes sense
    3.  Apply it on to something else

    FASTER WAY TO WORK WITH I/O BOUND DATA

      **TYPES OF I/O BOUDN DATA**
        1.  Network
        2.  Disks
        3.  DataBase

    ALL STREAMS ARE INSTANCES OF EVENT EMITTER
      - you can listen for events a.k.a. event listener
      - buttons are example of somehting that 'emits events'
      - the event listener addes a handler to 'handle' the event
      - you can add event listeners to streams

    **STREAM CLASSES**  https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html

      1.  Readable
      2.  Writable
      3.  Duplex
      4.  Transform

    **PIPES

      - Readable streams can be piped to writable streams

**PORTS AND SOCKETS**

  HOST
    - host needs to be listening to a port
  IP
    - internet protocol

  **when you run live-server, that service is listening on port *selected port*(usually 8080)

  COMMON PORTS

  ** 80 is the HTTP port for the interwebs **

  ** 443 is the port HTTPS **

  ** 22 SSH **

  ** 53 DNS **

  ALL OF THESE PORTS ARE UNDER 1024
    - These are reserved ports
    - Must have priveleges to bind on those ports
  *SERVICES NEED TO BIND A A PORT AND HOST**

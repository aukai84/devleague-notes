OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

  CLASSES......OBJECTS....INSTANCES

  *SCROLL PIC*
    - The scroll is a class
    - the house is an instance of a class

    When you build it its called instantiating an Object
    **can create many houses from blueprint**
    **all start out with same features**

    - classes all have properties and methods

    UML - universal meta language or markup language
    ERD - entity relationship diagram

    CLASS === HOUSE
      Properties:{
        windows: number
        doors: number
        color: string
        flooring: string
      }
      Methods: {
        open doors
        cook food
        condition air
        entetain
      }

    INHERITANCE

    *SCROLL PIC*

    CLASS === MOBILE HOME
      **inherit prototype of mobile home**
      - Mobile Home extends House (copy of house)
      - Mobile Home has every property and method of house
      - You can add properties and methods to mobile home without adding to house
      - You can override the directions to a method

  OOP, DEFINING CLASSES, INSTANTIATING OBJECTS

  **CONSTRUCTOR**

  function Person() {
    //method that is invoked on instantiation
  }
  //you use PascalCased fo class declarations
  //instantiating object of the perosn class

  var nakaz = new Person(); //woohoo

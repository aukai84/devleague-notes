FINAL PROJECT NOTES

- traffic cam at location
- warning for high

OVER TIME
- specific place is doing better? worse? same?
- compare two places.  current and future location comparison


**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
1.  Specific location View
    - specific location data
    - for traffic incidents and crime incidents
    - only using Hawaii data for specific locations
    - show historical incidents in surrounding area
    - able to search for future locations and see incidents in areas
    EX. search for Mooses and see surrounding area
2.  State View
    - state view shows aggregate historic data for incidents
    - split up by city
    - slider and incident type checkmark to visualize data
    - DATA SET FOR THIS VIEW IS SEPARATE FROM SPECIFIC
    - MAYBE SHOW HOT SPOT VIEW IN THIS STATE VIEW
3.  Country View
    - view has aggregate data for each state involving incidents
    - able to click on specific state to take you to state view
    - needs some sort of data visualization
    - DATA SET FOR THIS VIEW IS SEPARATE FROM SPECIFIC
4.  COMPARISON VIEWS
    - One view showing current location and "future" locations comparing incident differences
    - One view showing a specific

DAY 1

**VIEWS**

HOME

NATIONWIDE

    3. timeline bar static on bottom of map
    4. graphs popout tab
        - many graphs w/ timeline**hard**

STREET


**DEVOPS**

1.Registrar
    - set the nameserver ex. *ed.com ->  nameservers -> ns1.digitalocean.com || ns2.digitalocean.com (means that you have dns records at said place) for this domain **ed.com** ALL CAPITAL
2.DNS HOST/RECORDS
    - registrar points to dns host
    - ed.com -> 1.2.3.4.... will see ed.com then resolve to 1.2.3.4...
    - jon.ed.com -> jons box has 1.2.3.5? he has a different box pointing to a different ip address
    - no name -> resolves to a 404 or error ** anything that doesn't match resolves to (reroute?)

3.IP ADDRESS HAVE TTL **TIME TO LIVE**
    - have a time to live
    - you can set the time
    - if you make a change it takes time to change across the entire scale
    - if you change the nameservers you may experience down time
    - make sure destination that is pointed to is already set up

**RULES ABOUT DEV OPS**

1. NEVER STORE SECURITY.. INFORMATION.. BLA BLA NEVER STORE SECURE INFO
2. LINUX ON BOXES.  NEVER RUN AS ROOT EVER **ROOT IS ACCESS TO ANYTHING.. ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS**

          |PORT| |username|   |host domain or ipaddress|

    - create admin user -> useradd -h help
                                   -m -g users -G sudo -s /bin/bash admin
